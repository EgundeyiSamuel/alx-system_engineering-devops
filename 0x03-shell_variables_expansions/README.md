# Shell, Initialization Files, Variables, and Expansions

This project was completed during my **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. Its primary goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of shell scripting, including alias builtins, help builtins, local and global variables (such as PATH, HOME, and PS1), special parameters like `$?`, and the use of single and double quotes in **Shell**.

## Technologies Used

* Bash 4.3.11(1) for writing scripts.
* Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

## Files

All of the following files are shell scripts:

| Filename               | Description                                           |
| -----------------------| ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `0-alias`              | Creates an alias.                                    |
| `1-hello_you`          | Prints `hello user`, where "user" is the current Linux user. |
| `2-path`               | Adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` becomes the last directory the shell looks into when searching for a program. |
| `3-paths`              | Counts the number of directories in the `PATH`.      |
| `4-global_variables`   | Lists environment variables.                          |
| `5-local_variables`    | Lists all local variables, environment variables, and functions. |
| `6-create_local_variable` | Creates a new local variable named `BETTY`.       |
| `7-create_global_variable` | Creates a new global variable named `HOLBERTON`. |
| `8-true_knowledge`     | Prints the result of adding 128 to the value stored in the environment variable `TRUEKNOWLEDGE`, followed by a new line. |
| `9-divide_and_rule`    | Prints the result of dividing `POWER` by `DIVIDE`, followed by a new line. |
| `10-love_exponent_breath` | Displays the result of raising `BREATH` to the power of `LOVE`. |
| `11-binary_to_decimal` | Converts a number from base 2 to base 10.           |
| `12-combinations`      | Prints all possible combinations of two letters, except "oo". |
| `13-print_float`       | Prints a number with two decimal places. The number is stored in the environment variable `NUM`. |
| `14-decimal_to_hexadecimal` | Converts a number from base 10 to base 16.     |
